Welcome to the TCP Chatroom

To run the application you need to have a Python compiler/interpreter.

1. Run Server.py.
2. Run Client.py (run as many instances as you want for clients).

To write a private message use the format '/msg <nickname> <text>'.
The private message will appear with a '/' to the user.
It will only appear to the client that the message was sent to.

To send a public message, simply send the text.
It will appear for everyone who is in the chat (Including you).

To quit the application use the command '/quit' or simply close the window.
